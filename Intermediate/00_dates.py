# dates

'''
A date in Python is not a data type of its own, 
but we can import a module named datetime to work with dates as date objects.

# Import the class "datetime" of the module "datetime".
'''
The datetime module supplies classes for manipulating dates and times. 
While date and time arithmetic is supported, 
the focus of the implementation is on efficient attribute extraction for output formatting and manipulation.

from datetime import datetime

# Import module month_name

    print ("Today is %s %dth of the year %d " %(calendar.month_name[now.month],now.day,now.year))

# Get that day is today

# print hour, minute, second....

# timestamp 
'''
imestamp is the date and time of occurrence of an event. 
In Python we can get the timestamp of an event to an accuracy of milliseconds. 
The timestamp format in Python returns the time elapsed from the epoch time which is set to 00:00:00 UTC 
for 1 January 1970.
